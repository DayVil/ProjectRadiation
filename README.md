# ProjectRadiation
This is an Android app that can provide you with information about allergens at a defined location. A working demo may be found in the demo subsection. Also, this project may be hard to build due to the necessary API keys.  
For air pollution and the UV index, OpenWeather is being used, while for pollen, the Tomorrow.io API is being used.

## Demo
Here you can see a quick demo of the project:
